          Just like humans, dogs can benefit greatly from the power of touch.
          Canine massage is not only a luxurious treat for your beloved pet, but
          it also offers a myriad of health benefits that promote relaxation,
          pain relief, and overall well-being. Whether your canine companion is
          an active athlete, a senior dog with joint stiffness, or simply in
          need of some TLC, this ancient healing art can work wonders.

        <h3 className="text-lg mt-4">Benefits of Canine Massage</h3>
        <ol className="my-4">
          <li className="mb-4">
            1.{" "}
            <span className="font-extrabold">Reduces stress and anxiety:</span>{" "}
            Dogs can become stressed and anxious just like humans. Massage
            therapy can help to calm the nervous system and promote relaxation,
            reducing stress and anxiety in dogs.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            2. <span className="font-extrabold">Improves circulation:</span>{" "}
            Massage therapy can improve circulation by increasing blood flow to
            the muscles and other tissues. This can help to reduce inflammation
            and promote healing.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            3.{" "}
            <span className="font-extrabold">Relieves pain and tension:</span>{" "}
            Helps to relieve pain and tension in the muscles, joints, and other
            soft tissues. This can be especially beneficial for dogs with
            arthritis or other chronic conditions.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            4. <span className="font-extrabold">Enhances bonding:</span> Massage
            therapy can help to strengthen the bond between dogs and their
